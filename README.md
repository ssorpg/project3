## *The Private Network:*
is a social network that you can control access to. Use it to keep in touch with your friends and family, hold events for your office, or to organize your child’s sports team. Hold events, send messages, and post your important news to only selected individuals in your network.

## *Project objective:*
To create a safe, private social network under the control of the network’s creator - not a corporation.
